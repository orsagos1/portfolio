      <h2 class="sectionTitle">About Claire</h2>
      <p>After graduating from Ohio Northern University with a degree in Graphic Design and a minor in Marketing, I began working at as an in-house Videographer at a woodworking tool manufacture in Cleveland. While I enjoyed doing this, I found myself more and more interested in learning about code and developing websites.</p>
      
      <p>Shortly after, I began my journey at Thinkful and have been enjoying working toward becoming a software developer.</p>
      
      <p>Outside of my new coding journey, I am a high school girls' basketball coach at my alma mater! I have always thrived working in a team setting, and am so grateful to be able to share my passion and knowledge for the game with the girls I coach.</p>
      
      <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer who loves collaboration and teamwork, please feel free to reach out!</p>
